# Scale Pattern Generator
This program allows users to generate patterns of notes from a specified musical scale, enabling them to see all of the notes at once in Musescore and aiding in this type of pattern practicing that many jazz musicians do.

Patterns are generated by first choosing a key and scale type, then specifying the pattern sequence, which is a string of integers that describes the number of steps to take in the scale at each point in the pattern.

Python's Music21 library must be downloaded and configured with a locally installed music notation software, such as Musescore, for visual display, although the notes may still be printed in the console without this.

Below is an example of generating a common pattern from the diminished scale.
